== Project Name
Pick-Your-Menu

== Project Client
Herr Prof. Thomas St√ºtz

== Project Background
As we all know there are sometimes
some misunderstandings between the waiter
and the customer in terms of not speaking
the same language or just normal understanding
problems. To solve this problem but also to
make everything faster and easier we wanted to
develop an app which solves all these problems
in a restaurant.

== Final Result
The result is an application which allows us to
order what ever we want represented on the menu.
It is only an application for the restaurants. That
means that only restaurants have access to the app.
It is not a mobile app for customers.

== Project Goal
* better overview of the menu
* faster/easier decision-making
* the customer gets his food earlier
* easier for the staff
* no misunderstandings between the customer and the staff

== Project Description
* navbar for different categories (drinks, main dish, dessert, ...)
* every dish/drink has a picture of it
* ingredients and prices of specific dishes/drinks are also shown
* at the end of the order the bill is displayed
